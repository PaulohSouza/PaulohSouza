The success formula:
[(Dedication + Sacrifices) *(number of study hours)]^patience = SUCCESS.
success <- function(motivation = "" ) {
if(motivation == TRUE){
cat("If you develop the habits of success, you will make success a habit.\n")
}
else{
cat("Try again!")
}

"success is trainable." (JOEL JOTA)
